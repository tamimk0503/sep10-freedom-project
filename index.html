                    Before we get started on the technology used in casinos, let's define it first. Casinos are places which are super eye catching and where you can play many gambling games such as blackjack, poker, roulette, and many more with the goal of making money but with the chance of losing money. However with online casinos which we will be talking about it is basically the same but remove actually going to there physically and includes more games and more modern things such as using crypto currency.

However for the future I suggest an idea that we have a literal coin with a bit of a depth for a switch and on that coin you can tap on a selected area and throw it on the floor for either a poker table and in that poker table you could see holographic avatars of other people who are playing alongside with you or a kiosk in which it changes shapes depending on the game like if it was a slot machine then you would see a lever you could pull and hope for your chances. Hopefully with the invention it solves the issues of using a VR headset as you could feel nauseous after a while of using it and being more excited then just looking at a screen.</p>
