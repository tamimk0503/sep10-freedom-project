                    Before we get started on the technology used in casinos, let's define it first. Casinos are places which are super eye catching and where you can play many gambling games such as blackjack, poker, roulette, and many more with the goal of making money but with the chance of losing money. However with online casinos which we will be talking about it is basically the same but remove actually going to there physically and includes more games and more modern things such as using crypto currency.

                <h6 class="card-title">Present</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">In present Day we have many companys such as RTG(Real Time Gaming), IGT(International Game Technology) and Microgaming be involved with the software end of casinos.</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">RTG emphasizes high speed playability, ultra-sophistication without losing ease of use by  implementing specific algorithms to promote the spirit of gambling </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">IGT was in the game before online casinos and they focused on slot machines prior and bought the WagerWorks brand to work on the online casinos with them being known for the quality of the games they offer.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"> Microgaming is usually referred to as the first of online casino software and have been doing this for over 20 years with their platform being in many languages and it being used in hundreds of online casinos. </li>

                <h6 class="card-title">Future</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Since we are talking about a future here is an idea for what we can do about online casinos on the future. In conjuctions with using a VR headset we could potentially create a game that would be like a replica to an actual casinos but instead of it trying to achieve looking realistic we could instead have it have it's own goofy art style and that would also be reflected on avatar that could be made in the game to where in addition to winning money they would potentially win cosmetics and with those they could have it on their character or trade it and that could also be an alternative way of making money instead of the many casino games provided. </p>

                    <li class="list-group-item">The game control unit or GCU is known as an integral part of any live casino game. This software device is quite small, and it stays hidden at every blackjack table in a casino. GCU devices help dealers conduct live casino games online while preserving game fairness and transparency.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">They use computer servers so they can access online gamblers in different parts of the world and that  they serve as communication ports/centers connecting the main system with peripheral devices</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Cameras are also being used in online casinos since they connect the player to the dealer and shows them the playing table and all the materials such as cards to give a sense of feeling like you are there participating and playing the game</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h6 class="card-title">Future</h6>
                <p class="card-text">In the future we could use VR headsets as they will eventually drop in price and things such as the metaverse which if are successful will see a boom in people buying them and it would fit in with the metaverse. With VR headsets they could potentially sort out their flaws such as facing headaches, eye strain, dizziness and nausea and the picture quality of these improving to emphasize the art style and potentially get the person to admire what they are seeing and get them to stay and play for longer </p>
